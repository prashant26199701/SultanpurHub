How To Install -
---
1. Create Database food.
2. Run food.sql script provided in sql folder.
3. Go to Food portal and then go Registration or login.php and try out our application.
4. Sample user credentials can be found in users table.

Note -
---
1. This is not ready for PRODUCTION.
2. The username and password of sample users are stored in table `users`.
3. What's lacking? Dynamic payment(real payment system) and error reporting lacks in this project. And also one might wish for showing corresponding food item's photo and all that stuff.
